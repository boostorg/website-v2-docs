= Development Best Practices
:navtitle: Best Practices

This section contains guidance on how to reduce development time from concept through to publishing of a new library, whilst ensuring a quality and maintainability to the open source project that will be the result.

* <<Beneficial Dependencies>>
* <<GitHub Strategies>>
* <<Commenting Code>>

== Beneficial Dependencies

Some libraries are published with the intended primary audience, or in some cases the sole audience, being developers of other libraries. These libraries are published to make some of the time consuming and awkward processes of Boost-compliance easier. It is good practice for a new library developer to read the introductions to each of these libraries, and ascertain if they might be of value to the library they are developing.

== GitHub Strategies

Always submit changes to a Boost repo using a Pull Request (PR), never use the GitHub website to change the contents of a repository directly.

It is good practice to bring your local repo up to date before submitting a PR, perhaps on a weekly or even daily basis - depending on the activity in the repo.

Merge commits are to be avoided. These commits happens when a local origin branch and remote branch are out of sync. 

The focus is on strategies that emphasize _linear history_, _rebasing_, and _collaborative discipline_. What follows are the best practices that can help.

=== Use Rebase Instead of Merge

When integrating changes from one branch into another, use `git rebase` instead of `git merge`. This rewrites the commit history, applying your changes on top of the target branch and maintains a linear history. Keep branches short-lived and focused on specific features or bug fixes. This reduces the likelihood of conflicts and simplifies rebasing onto the main branch. Regularly rebase your feature branch onto main or the target branch to keep up with upstream changes and avoid a large, complex integration at the end. For example:

[source, bash]
----
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
----

Then push changes after resolving any conflicts:

[source, bash]
----
git push --force
----

=== Always Pull Using Rebase

Configure your Git client to rebase when pulling changes, rather than creating merge commits:

[source, bash]
----
git config --global pull.rebase true
----

When working collaboratively on a branch, use `git pull --rebase` to fetch and reapply your local changes on top of the latest commits from the remote branch.

[source, bash]
----
git pull --rebase origin main
----

=== Squash Commits Before Merging

Use interactive rebasing (`git rebase -i`) to clean up your branch history and squash multiple commits into one meaningful commit. This keeps the repository history tidy and avoids unnecessary merge commits.

[source, bash]
----
git rebase -i HEAD~n  # Replace 'n' with the number of commits to squash
----

After squashing, you can fast-forward the branch without creating a merge commit:

[source, bash]
----
git checkout main
git rebase feature-branch
----

=== Use Fast-Forward Merges

Enable fast-forward-only merges to ensure the branch history is linear. This avoids creating a merge commit.

[source, bash]
----
git merge --ff-only feature-branch
----

Configure the repository to enforce fast-forward merges:

[source, bash]
----
git config --global merge.ff only
----

=== Enforce Commit Discipline

Avoid unnecessary commits and ensure that every commit is meaningful. Use `git add -p` or `git commit --amend` to refine commits before pushing.

[source, bash]
----
git commit --amend
----

This ensures that when changes are rebased or fast-forwarded, the history remains clean and easy to understand.

By following these practices, you'll avoid merge commits and maintain a clean, linear history in your Git repository while keeping the dev community happy! 

[[comments]]
== Commenting Code

Boost has informal coding standards that encourage clear, concise, and useful comments. The following are the main policy recommendations:

. Doxygen-style comments for documenting APIs.
. _Explanatory_ comments preceding a function for complex logic and important decisions.
. Minimal but meaningful _inline_ comments.

=== Doxygen API Comments

Boost libraries can use https://www.doxygen.nl/[Doxygen] to generate API reference documentation from specifically formatted comments. Many libraries follow this structure, for example:

[source, cpp]
----
/// \brief Brief description of the function
/// \details More detailed explanation if necessary.
/// \param x Description of parameter x
/// \return Description of return value
int my_function(int x);

----

This makes it easier to generate consistent and readable documentation for users, as the build process picks up the triple-slash comments and creates API documentation automatically from them. Here is a more complete example using all the most useful annotations:

[source, cpp]
----
#include <cmath>
#include <stdexcept>

/**
 * @brief Computes the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.
 * 
 * This function calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.
 * It uses Heron's formula, which states that for a triangle with sides a, b, and c:
 * 
 * \f[
 * A = \sqrt{s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c)}
 * \f]
 * 
 * where \f$s\f$ is the semi-perimeter:
 * 
 * \f[
 * s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
 * \f]
 * 
 * @param a The length of the first side (must be positive).
 * @param b The length of the second side (must be positive).
 * @param c The length of the third side (must be positive).
 * @return The computed area of the triangle.
 * @throws std::invalid_argument if the sides do not form a valid triangle.
 * @throws std::domain_error if the computed area is invalid due to floating-point errors.
 */
double computeTriangleArea(double a, double b, double c) {
    if (a <= 0 || b <= 0 || c <= 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("All side lengths must be positive.");
    }

    // Check for the triangle inequality
    if (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("The given sides do not form a valid triangle.");
    }

    // Calculate semi-perimeter
    double s = (a + b + c) / 2.0;

    // Compute area using Heron's formula
    double area = std::sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));

    if (std::isnan(area) || area <= 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Computed area is invalid due to floating-point errors.");
    }

    return area;
}

----

The most useful Doxygen annotations are:

[cols="1,4",options="header",stripes=even,frame=none]
|===
| *Annotation* | *Description* 
| `@brief` | A short summary of the function's purpose.
| `@param` | Describes the function parameters and their constraints.
| `@return` | Explains the function's return value.
| `@throws` | Lists the possible exceptions that the function may throw.
|===

Notes:: 
* For mathematical formulas the `\f[ ... \f]` tags render inline https://www.latex-project.org/[LaTeX]-style math formulas in the generated documentation. 
* `@brief` is used inside block comments  (`/** ... */`), while `\brief` works with both block and single-line (`///`) comments. Good practice is simply being consistent with your preference.

=== Explanatory Comments

Since many Boost libraries aim to be compatible with (or eventually integrated into) the https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/standard_library[Standard Library], you might adopt commenting styles similar to standard library headers, keeping explanations brief, precise, and technical. Sometimes though, the comments are more numerous and helpful in specific implementations, such as Clang pass:[libc++], GNU pass:[libstc++] or MSVC STL. The following code comes from `std::vector::resize` in pass:[libc++].

[source, cpp]
----
/**
 * @brief Resizes the container to contain @p __sz elements.
 *
 * If @p __sz is smaller than the current size, the container is reduced to its first @p __sz elements.
 * If @p __sz is greater than the current size, additional default-constructed elements are appended.
 *
 * @param __sz The new size of the container.
 *
 * If an expansion is needed and sufficient capacity exists, no reallocation occurs.
 * Otherwise, new storage is allocated and existing elements are moved.
 *
 * @exception If an exception is thrown during element construction or move, the container remains unchanged.
 * 
 * Complexity: Linear in the difference between old and new size.
 */
template <class _Tp, class _Allocator>
void vector<_Tp, _Allocator>::resize(size_type __sz) {
    if (__sz < size()) {

        // Shrink: Destroy extra elements
        erase(begin() + __sz, end());
    } else if (__sz > size()) {

        // Grow: Append default-constructed elements
        insert(end(), __sz - size(), _Tp());
    }
}

----

Note:: Both exception safety and performance considerations are covered in the comments above, which are good practices!

Boost encourages documenting exception safety guarantees (`noexcept`, strong guarantee, basic guarantee), and thread-safety considerations if applicable. For example:

[source, cpp]
----
/// \pre `ptr` must not be null.
/// \post Returns a valid shared_ptr managing `ptr`.
/// \throws std::bad_alloc if allocation fails.
std::shared_ptr<T> safe_wrap(T* ptr);

----

Some Boost libraries include comments explaining design choices, performance considerations, or trade-offs. These are typically found in complex implementations like boost:hana[], boost:asio[] or boost:spirit[]. Here's an example from the boost:hana[] library, which demonstrates the use of comments to explain the code's purpose and functionality:

[source, cpp]
----
/*!
@file
Defines `boost::hana::transform`.
*/

namespace boost { namespace hana {
    
    //! Transform each element of a sequence with a given function.
    //! @ingroup group-Sequence
    //! 
    //! Example:
    //! @code
    //! auto doubled = hana::transform(hana::make_tuple(1, 2, 3), [](auto x) { return x * 2; });
    //! @endcode
    //! doubled == hana::make_tuple(2, 4, 6)
    //!
    template <typename Xs, typename F>
    constexpr auto transform(Xs&& xs, F&& f) {
 
        // See below for the commented version of this function.
    }
}}

----

Note:: The `@file` entry provides an overview of the file contents. The `//!` syntax precedes a function-level Doxygen comment, providing an example usage of the function `hana::transform` in the code snippet above.

=== Inline Comments

Inline comments, throughout the source code, are used to explain the purpose of specific statements. This example is taken from `hana::transform`, mentioned previously.

[source, cpp]
----
    constexpr auto transform(Xs&& xs, F&& f) {
        return hana::adjust_if(

            static_cast<Xs&&>(xs), // Forward the sequence `xs`

            [](auto const&) { return true; }, // Always apply the transformation

            static_cast<F&&>(f) // Forward the transformation function
        );
    }
----

Here is another example of inline commenting, from the boost:asio[] library, notice how the comments make understanding the flow easy.

[source, cpp]
----
void start_read() {

    // Prepare a buffer to store incoming data.
    socket_.async_read_some(boost::asio::buffer(data_, max_length),
        [this](boost::system::error_code ec, std::size_t length) {
            if (!ec) { 

                // Successfully read some data, process it.
                handle_data(data_, length);

                // Initiate another asynchronous read to continue receiving data.
                start_read();
            } else {

                // An error occurred, log and handle it.
                handle_error(ec);
            }
        });
}

----

Here is a more in-depth example, showing how to comment non-trivial code behavior (for example, shared pointers, async operations). The comments also describe _purpose_ rather than restating code (for example, "Keep session alive" rather than "Creates a shared pointer"). And finally the comments guide the reader through the flow (such as explaining what happens after a read or write).

[source, cpp]
----
#include <boost/asio.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <utility>

using boost::asio::ip::tcp;

class Session : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Session> {
public:
    explicit Session(tcp::socket socket) 

        : socket_(std::move(socket)) {}  // Move socket into this session

    void start() { 

        read();  // Begin reading data from the client
    }

private:
    void read() {

        auto self = shared_from_this();  // Ensure session remains alive during async operation

        // Asynchronous read operation
        socket_.async_read_some(boost::asio::buffer(data_, max_length),
            [self](boost::system::error_code ec, std::size_t length) {
                if (!ec) {

                    // Successfully received data, now send a response
                    self->write(length);
                } else {

                    // Handle connection errors (e.g., client disconnected)
                    std::cerr << "Read error: " << ec.message() << std::endl;
                }
            });
    }

    void write(std::size_t length) {

        auto self = shared_from_this();  // Keep session alive for async write

        // Asynchronous write operation
        boost::asio::async_write(socket_, boost::asio::buffer(data_, length),
            [self](boost::system::error_code ec, std::size_t /*bytes_transferred*/) {
                if (!ec) {

                    // Successfully wrote data, continue reading for more client input
                    self->read();
                } else {

                    // Handle write error (e.g., broken pipe)
                    std::cerr << "Write error: " << ec.message() << std::endl;
                }
            });
    }

    tcp::socket socket_;
    enum { max_length = 1024 };

    char data_[max_length];  // Buffer to store incoming data
};

// Server class that listens for incoming connections
class Server {
public:
    Server(boost::asio::io_context& io_context, short port)
        : acceptor_(io_context, tcp::endpoint(tcp::v4(), port)) {

        accept();  // Start listening for connections
    }

private:
    void accept() {
        acceptor_.async_accept(
            [this](boost::system::error_code ec, tcp::socket socket) {
                if (!ec) {

                    // Successfully accepted a connection, create a session
                    std::make_shared<Session>(std::move(socket))->start();
                } else {

                    // Log accept error
                    std::cerr << "Accept error: " << ec.message() << std::endl;
                }

                // Continue accepting new connections
                accept();
            });
    }

    tcp::acceptor acceptor_;
};

// Main function to run the server
int main() {
    try {
        boost::asio::io_context io_context;

        Server server(io_context, 12345);  // Start server on port 12345

        io_context.run();  // Run the IO context to handle async operations
    } catch (std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
}

----

Note:: Inline comments are clearer if they are preceded by a blank line. Many libraries do not strictly stick to this practice, but it should be clear from the above example that the preceding-blank-line is a best practice for readability.
