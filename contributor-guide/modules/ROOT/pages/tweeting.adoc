:navtitle: Tweeting


The collection is represented on social media by the https://twitter.com/boostlibraries[@BoostLibraries,role=resource,window=_blank]
X (formerly Twitter) account, where news and information about our libraries in particular and C++ in general are shared
with the community.

== What gets posted

The account publishes two types of posts:

* *Official posts*: These inform the community about new releases and libraries, library proposals,
review schedules and results, and generally all the events associated to the evolution and deployment of the project.
Official posts have a Boost brand imagery with watermark, and are produced by volunteers.
* *Non-official posts*: Everything else. Imagery for these posts is not branded so that they can be told from
the former. Anyone from the community can propose a non-official post for publication; if you're interested in
doing so, follow these simple guidelines:

== Topics of interest

* Upcoming C++ events, meetups, conferences, etc.
* Talks about some particular library, or where such library is put to good effect.
* Boost-related articles, blogposts, C++ Committee papers.
* Interesting discussions ongoing on Reddit or some other online forums.

The list is not exhaustive: if in doubt, just go with your submission or ask
for guidance using the same submission channel.

== Post structure

image::tweet_structure.jpg[Structure of an X post]

*Text:* Make it short and attractive. Posts in X are currently capped at
280 characters, but you should strive for even less than that: one or two sentences
should suffice. Go straight to the point and phrase your sentences with a
clear call to action ("learn about", "watch", "contribute", you get the idea).

*Link(s)*: After the text, the post must include a link (or maybe more) to the
piece of news, talk, etc. you're posting about. Links can be provided as-is
or with a short introductory text (like "Check it out: _link_"). There's no
need to pass the links through an URL shortener: X does it automatically
with its own shortening service.

*Hashtags*: The post should end with the following:

`#boost` `#boostcpp` `#cpp` `#cplusplus`

plus other hashtags specific to the post you're proposing. Experiment with
different hashtags to see what X search brings on them.

*Image*: Always provide an image to go with the text â€”this dramatically
increases the visibility and reach of your post. The image should be
as large as possible. X accepts any aspect ratio, but given that
the majority of accesses will be through a mobile device, consider
ratios close to 1:1 or even taller than wider.
In our era of constant fight for attention and
information overload, the actual content of the image is less important
than how it will stand out amidst X infinite scroll: so,  favor
colorful, original images that will make readers pause for a moment
and read the post (which is where the real info is shared).

Making the perfect post is not trivial: if you need inspiration,
go to https://twitter.com/boostlibraries[@BoostLibraries,role=resource,window=_blank] for actual
post examples.

== Post submission

Log into the https://cpplang.slack.com/[C++ Language Slack Workspace,role=resource,window=_blank]
(or https://cppalliance.org/slack/[join it,role=resource,window=_blank] if you're not a member yet)
and post a message in the
https://cpplang.slack.com/archives/C27KZLB0X[`#boost`,role=resource,window=_blank] channel, including:

* Main text
* Link(s), with or without introductory texts
* Hashtags
* Attached image (or link to it)

The team in charge of https://twitter.com/boostlibraries[@BoostLibraries,role=resource,window=_blank]
may make some editorial adjustments
to your submission or get back to you to help them polish the final post.
Also, they will schedule the publication date and time for
maximum impact (typically, on weekday mornings with an eye to
catching readers both sides of the Atlantic, but this may be adjusted
for events specific to some country or geographical area).
