== Version 1.90.0

// Date of release
Month Day, Year Hour::Minute GMT

boost_at:/doc/libs/1_90_0/[Documentation]

// Formatting reference: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/
// Boost-specific macros: https://github.com/cppalliance/asciidoctor-boost?tab=readme-ov-file#macros
// Please keep the list of libraries sorted in lexicographical order.

== New Libraries

// Example:
// 
// * boost_phrase:library[Accumulators,/libs/accumulators]:
// ** Framework for incremental calculation, and collection of statistical
// accumulators, from Eric Niebler.

* boost_phrase:library[OpenMethod,/libs/openmethod]:
** Open-(multi-)methods in C++17 and above, from Jean-Louis Leroy.

== Updated Libraries

// Example:
//  
// * boost_phrase:library[Interprocess,/libs/interprocess/]:
// ** Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
// ** Conform to `std::pointer_traits` requirements (boost_gh:pr[interprocess,32]).
// ** Fixed `named_condition_any` fails to notify (boost_gh:issue[interprocess,62]).

* boost_phrase:library[Bloom,/libs/bloom/]:
** Added bulk-mode insertion and lookup for increased performance.
** Made lookup implementation branchless for `block`, `fast_multiblock32`
and `fast_multiblock64`, which results in some performance gains,
particularly for mixed successful/unsuccessful queries.

* boost_phrase:library[DynamicBitset,/libs/dynamic_bitset/]:
** Removed max_size_workaround().
** Added some missing const qualifiers.
** Increased the test coverage.
** Also tested std::hash with bitsets having equal underlying vectors.
** Made the implementation of find_next() consistent with that of find_next_off().
** Used the typename keyword for the template parameter of minimal_allocator.
** Assumed locales and std::use_facet() are always available.
** Copy edited a comment.
** Parenthesized a macro parameter.
** Reused nth_bit() in bitset_test::append_block().

** Made the descriptions of the preconditions of the three "from string" constructors more precise.
** Added a constructor from basic_string_view in C++17 or later.
** Added a constructor from const CharT * (pointer to C-style string).

** Actually tested the move constructor in the move constructor tests.
** Replaced a #include of a deprecated include file.
** Added missing const qualifiers.
** Made lowest_bit() more efficient.
