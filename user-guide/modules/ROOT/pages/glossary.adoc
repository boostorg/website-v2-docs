== S

*Safe pass:[C++]* : Currently a https://safecpp.org/P3390R0.html[proposal for a memory-safe set of pass:[C++] operations]. Key concepts of memory safety include:

* *Borrowing* : this refers to a feature of an ownership system that allows a variable to grant temporary access to its data without giving up ownership. _Immutable borrowing_ allows others to read but not modify data. Multiple immutable borrows are allowed at the same time. With _mutable borrowing_ others can modify the data, but only one mutable borrow is allowed at any one time (to prevent data races), and the owner cannot modify the value until the borrow ends. Borrowing enforces lifetimes - so borrowed references do not outlive the original data.
* *Borrow checking* : a kind of compile-time analysis that prevents using a reference after an object has gone out of scope.
* *Choice types* : a _choice type_ is similar to an enum, but contains a type-safe selection of alternative types.
* *Explicit mutation* : all mutations are explicit, so there are no uncertain side-effects.
* *Interior mutability* : types with interior mutability implement deconfliction strategies to support shared mutation, without the risk of data races or violating exclusivity.
* *Pattern matching* : the only way to access alternatives of _Choice types_ to ensure type-safety.
* *Relocation object model* : a memory model that supports relocation/destruction of local objects, in order to satisfy type safety.
* *Send and sync* : these are _type traits_ that ensure memory safety between threads. The _send_ is enabled for a variable if it is safe to transfer ownership of its value to another thread. A _sync_ trait is enabled if it is safe to share a reference to a value with other threads. 
* *The `safe` context* : operations in the `safe` context are guaranteed not to cause undefined behavior. 

*SHA* : Secure Hash Algorithm, a function that will reliably give different hash values for different inputs.

*SFINAE* or *SFINAED* : _Substitution Failure Is Not An Error_

*SMOP* : _Small Matter of Programming_ - sarcastically downplaying complex problems

*SOLID* : Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion (Design principles)

*SSA* : Static Single Assignment - a property of intermediate representations (IRs) used in compilers. SSA is a popular technique in modern compilers to make optimizations and analysis simpler and more efficient. Each variable is assigned exactly once and is immutable after assignment. If a variable is updated, a new variable is created instead. Refer also to *Phi* functions.
