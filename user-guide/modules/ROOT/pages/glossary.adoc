= Glossary

You will find a myriad of jargon, acronyms and product or tool names used both in technical documentation and social media discussion of the Boost pass:[C++]Libraries and pass:[C++] development in general. This section contains descriptions of the most common.

You will find well known acronyms such as DLL, URL and UUID in this list, because they also refer to Boost libraries of the same name.

Where terms apply specifically to one technology, such as _Quantum Computing_ or _Safe C++_, many of the specific terms are only listed under the entry for that technology.

*Bikeshedding* or *BS* : _Focusing on trivial issues_

*Bloom Filter* : A space-efficient, fast, and probabilistic structure that can tell you if an item is _definitely not in a database_ or is _possibly in the database_. For example, say you have a database of bad actors that is used to help prevent fraudulent access to a financial web app. A bloom filter can be used to tell if a new transaction _definitely_ does not come from this set, so proceed normally, or _possibly comes from this set_ in which case a deeper investigation into its validity (a full search of the bad actors) should be carried out. The following diagram shows the flow of control:

image::bloom-filter.png[Bloom filter]

Bloom filters are stealthy players in many performance-critical applications. They're used in areas where fast lookups, limited memory, and tolerable false positive rates are acceptable. Blacklisted entity checks (fraud detection, compliance with sensitive data) is a top contender - other uses include:

* High-frequency trading, to track recent orders or trades to avoid duplicate processing.
* In URL, File or Query caches, to reduce IO and memory overhead by quickly testing if a URL/File/Query has been visited (cached) already.
* Database engines, to avoid unnecessary disk reads during key lookup - anything to avoid a full-text search.
* Bioinformatics, to reduce the number of comparisons between huge DNA sequences.

A Boost.Bloom library is currently in the formal review process.

Note:: The Bloom filter is named after its inventor, Burton Howard Bloom, who described its purpose in a 1970 paper - “Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors.”

Qt is known for its rich set of libraries and tools to develop not only graphical applications but also applications that require network handling, file I/O, and more.

*Quantum Computing* : Unlike classical computing based on bits which must have a value of 0 or 1, quantum computing is based on _qubits_ (see definition below) that can exist in multiple states at the same time. Still in the research phase, this technology can dramatically improve the performance of certain algorithms - especially those we currently call "brute-force" computing - in fields such as cryptography, chemistry simulation, graph traversing, and no doubt many others as new algorithms are discovered. We can currently simulate quantum algorithms in pass:[C++] - refer to xref:task-quantum-computing.adoc[]. There is a mass of new terminology to grasp - many of which have completely different meanings outside of quantum computing - including:

* *Bloch Sphere* : a geometric representation of a single qubit's state as a point on the surface of a unit sphere, useful for visualizing superposition and phase.
+
image::bloch-sphere.png[Bloch Sphere]
+
_The Bloch sphere is a 3D representation of a single qubit's state. Any point on the sphere's surface corresponds to a valid qubit state, with poles representing |0⟩ and |1⟩, and equatorial points representing equal superpositions. This tool helps visualize qubit transformations, such as rotations from quantum gates or decoherence effects over time._

* *Clifford+T Gate Set* : a universal set of quantum gates that includes _Clifford_ gates and the _T_ gate, used to construct fault-tolerant quantum circuits. The Clifford gate is a type of quantum gate that forms a foundational set of operations used in quantum error correction and stabilizer circuits. The T gate is a single-qubit quantum gate that applies a π/4 phase shift to the |1⟩ state, making it essential for achieving universal quantum computation when combined with Clifford gates.

* *Decoherence* : the process by which a quantum system loses its quantum properties (like superposition or entanglement) due to environmental interaction.

* *Entanglement* : a quantum phenomenon where two or more qubits become linked, such that measuring one affects the state of the others, regardless of distance.
+
image::entanglement.png[Entanglement]
+
_This shows a classic quantum circuit diagram demonstrating how to create an entangled pair of qubits (often called a Bell State). Qubit 0 (q₀) — starts in state |0⟩. Qubit 1 (q₁) — also starts in state |0⟩. A Hadamard Gate (H) is applied to q₀, which puts q₀ into a superposition: (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2. A CNOT gate is applied with q₀ as the control qubit, and q₁ as the target qubit. This entangles the qubits — their states become correlated. This means measuring q₀ as 0 forces q₁ to be 0, and measuring q₀ as 1 forces q₁ to be 1. Even if far apart, their outcomes are perfectly correlated — the hallmark of entanglement._

* *Hamiltonian* : an operator representing the total energy of a quantum system, governing how its state evolves over time via Schrödinger's equation.

* *Interference* : arises from the wave-like nature of quantum states, allowing quantum algorithms to amplify correct answers while canceling out incorrect ones, enhancing computational efficiency.

* *Measurement* : the act of observing a qubit's state, which causes its wavefunction to collapse into a definite classical outcome (0 or 1).

* *Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)* : 
A classification of current quantum devices with dozens to hundreds of qubits that are not yet error-corrected or scalable but still useful for experimentation.

* *QASM (Quantum Assembly Language)* : a low-level language for describing quantum circuits and operations, often used to interface with quantum simulators and hardware.

* *Qubit* : the basic unit of quantum information, capable of existing in a superposition of 0 and 1, unlike a classical bit which is strictly one or the other.

* *Qubit Connectivity (Topology)* : the layout that defines which qubits in a quantum computer can directly interact, affecting how efficiently quantum circuits can be executed.

* *Qubit Decoherence Time (T1, T2)* : _T1_ refers to how long a qubit holds its energy state (relaxation), and _T2_ refers to how long it maintains its phase (coherence) — both affect quantum stability.

* *Quantum Annealing* : an optimization technique that finds the lowest-energy configuration of a system by slowly evolving its quantum state.

* *Quantum Circuit* : a structured sequence of quantum gates applied to qubits to implement a quantum algorithm.
+
image::quantum-circuit.png[Quantum Circuit]
+
_This diagram shows a basic quantum circuit composed of qubit wires (horizontal lines) and quantum gates. The gates — such as Hadamard (H), CNOT, and Measurement (M) — manipulate the quantum state of the qubits. The circuit structure visually represents the flow of operations over time from left to right, forming the basis of all quantum algorithms._

* *Quantum Error Correction (QEC)* : techniques used to detect and correct quantum errors by encoding logical qubits across multiple physical qubits.

* *Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)* : a quantum algorithm for transforming a quantum state into its frequency domain - used in Shor's algorithm and other applications.

* *Quantum Gate* : a basic operation applied to qubits that changes their state, analogous to logic gates in classical circuits but with quantum behavior.

* *Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)* : an algorithm used to estimate the eigenvalue (phase) associated with an eigenvector of a unitary operator—central to many quantum applications.

* *Quantum Teleportation* : a process where the state of a qubit is transferred from one location to another, without moving the physical particle itself, by using entanglement and classical communication. It doesn't transmit matter or energy like in science fiction — instead, it “teleports” quantum information perfectly, but always requires destroying the original state.
+
image::quantum-teleportation.png[Quantum Teleportation]
+
_This diagram shows the basic process of quantum teleportation, where the unknown state of qubit |ψ⟩ (held by Alice) is transferred to Bob using entanglement and classical communication. The circuit begins with an entangled pair of qubits shared between Alice (qubit A) and Bob (qubit B). Alice performs a set of quantum operations — a CNOT gate followed by a Hadamard gate — on her qubits, then measures them. She sends the two classical measurement results (bits) to Bob over a classical channel. Bob then applies specific quantum gates (Pauli X and/or Z) depending on Alice's results, reconstructing the original state |ψ⟩ on his qubit — effectively completing the teleportation without physically moving the qubit itself._

* *Quantum Volume* : a benchmark that evaluates a quantum computer's ability to run complex circuits by factoring in gate fidelity, connectivity, and qubit count.

* *Superposition* : a principle in quantum mechanics where a qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallelism in computation.

[[s]]
== S

*Safe pass:[C++]* : There are memory-safe discussions and initiatives going on in the wider pass:[C++] development world, though it seems like it's a tough nut to crack. The https://safecpp.org/P3390R0.html[Safe pass:[C++]] proposal is currently in a state of indefinite hiatus. Key concepts of _memory-safety_, and it's partners _type-safety_ and _thread-safety_, include:

* *Borrowing* : this refers to a feature of an ownership system that allows a variable to grant temporary access to its data without giving up ownership. _Immutable borrowing_ allows others to read but not modify data. Multiple immutable borrows are allowed at the same time. With _mutable borrowing_ others can modify the data, but only one mutable borrow is allowed at any one time (to prevent data races), and the owner cannot modify the value until the borrow ends. Borrowing enforces lifetimes - so borrowed references do not outlive the original data.
* *Borrow checking* : a kind of compile-time analysis that prevents using a reference after an object has gone out of scope.
* *Choice types* : a _choice type_ is similar to an enum, but contains a type-safe selection of alternative types.
* *Explicit mutation* : all mutations are explicit, so there are no uncertain side-effects.
* *Interior mutability* : types with interior mutability implement deconfliction strategies to support shared mutation, without the risk of data races or violating exclusivity.
* *Pattern matching* : the only way to access alternatives of _Choice types_ to ensure type-safety.
* *Relocation object model* : a memory model that supports relocation/destruction of local objects, in order to satisfy type-safety.
* *Send and sync* : these are _type traits_ that ensure memory-safety between threads. The _send_ is enabled for a variable if it is safe to transfer ownership of its value to another thread. A _sync_ trait is enabled if it is safe to share a reference to a value with other threads. 
* *The `safe` context* : operations in the `safe` context are guaranteed not to cause undefined behavior. 

*SHA* : Secure Hash Algorithm, a function that will reliably give different hash values for different inputs.

*SFINAE* or *SFINAED* : _Substitution Failure Is Not An Error_

*SIGILS* : refers to symbols or characters that precede a variable, literal, or keyword to indicate its type or purpose. For example, in "%hash" the "%" is a sigil. It is occasionally used with a tongue-in-cheek tone because of its mystical connotations, referring to how these symbols can seem "magical" in making the code work! 

*SMOP* : _Small Matter of Programming_ - sarcastically downplaying complex problems

*SOLID* : Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion (Design principles)

*SSA* : Static Single Assignment - a property of intermediate representations (IRs) used in compilers. SSA is a popular technique in modern compilers to make optimizations and analysis simpler and more efficient. Each variable is assigned exactly once and is immutable after assignment. If a variable is updated, a new variable is created instead. Refer also to *Phi functions*.
