= Parallel Computation
:navtitle: Parallel Computation

Parallel computation is an important concept that helps in achieving faster execution by performing multiple operations concurrently. 

Parallel programming can be complex and requires careful handling of shared resources to avoid race conditions, deadlocks, and other concurrency-related bugs. It's also worth noting that not every problem can be efficiently parallelized; the potential speedup from parallelization is largely determined by the proportion of the computation that can be performed concurrently, as described by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law[Amdahl's Law].

== Libraries

The Boost libraries provide several tools that can help in writing parallel code:

[circle]
* boost:thread[]: Provides components for creating and managing threads, which can be used to perform multiple tasks concurrently on separate CPU cores.

* boost:asio[]: While primarily a xref:task-networking.adoc[] library, this library also provides tools for asynchronous programming, which can be used to write concurrent code that performs multiple tasks at the same time without necessarily using multiple CPU cores.

* boost:compute[]: This is a GPU/parallel computing library for pass:[C++] based on OpenCL. The library provides a high-level, STL-like API and is header-only and does not require any special build steps or linking.

* boost:fiber[]: Allows you to write code that works with fibers, which are user-space threads that can be used to write concurrent code. This can be useful in situations where you have many tasks that need to run concurrently but are I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound.

* boost:phoenix[]: A library for functional programming, it supports the ability to create inline functions which can be used for defining parallel algorithms.

* boost:atomic[]: This library provides low-level atomic operations, with the aim of ensuring correct and efficient concurrent access to shared data without data races or other undesirable behavior.

* boost:lockfree[] : Provides lock-free data structures which are useful in multi-threaded applications where you want to avoid locking overhead.

* boost:chrono[]: Measures time intervals, which help control the timing of your app.

== Parallel Computing Applications

Parallel computing has been successful in a wide range of applications, especially those involving large-scale computation or data processing. Here are some key areas where parallel computing has been particularly effective:

[circle]
* Scientific Computing and xref:task-simulation.adoc[]: Many problems in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering involve solving complex mathematical models, often represented as systems of differential equations. This includes simulations in fields like fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, and climate modeling.

* Data Analysis and xref:task-machine-learning.adoc[]: Training machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, involves many similar computations (like matrix multiplications), which can be performed in parallel. Similarly, analyzing large datasets (as in big data applications) can often be parallelized.

* Graphics and Gaming: Modern GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are essentially parallel processors, capable of performing many computations simultaneously. This is particularly useful in graphics rendering, which involves applying the same operations to many pixels or vertices. Video games, 3D animation, and virtual reality all benefit from parallel computing.

* xref:task-database.adoc[] and Data Warehouses: Many operations in databases, like searches, sorting, and joins, can be parallelized, leading to faster query times. This is particularly important in large-scale data warehouses.

* Cryptocurrency Mining: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin require solving complex mathematical problems, a process known as mining. This process is inherently parallel and is typically performed on GPUs or dedicated ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits).

* Genome Analysis and Bioinformatics: Tasks like genome sequencing, protein folding, and other bioinformatics tasks involve large amounts of data and can be greatly sped up using parallel computing.

* Weather Forecasting and Climate Research: Simulating weather patterns and climate change requires processing vast amounts of data and performing complex calculations, tasks well-suited to parallel computation.

== Multi-threaded Sample

The following code demonstrates using boost:thread[] to do the heavy lifting when you require a single foreground task, and multiple background tasks. 

The sample has the following features:

* The main thread prints status updates and listens for user input.
* Background threads simulate work (for example, processing data, handling network requests), in this case just printing messages every second.
* A shared flag (`running`) signals when to stop the threads.
* A `boost::mutex` ensures synchronized console output to prevent message overlap.
* The main thread waits for all background threads (`thread.join()`), ensuring a clean exit.

#include <boost/chrono.hpp>

// Shared flag to signal when to stop background threads
boost::atomic<bool> running(true);
boost::mutex coutMutex;  // Synchronizes console output

// Simulated background task
void backgroundTask(int id) {
    while (running) {
        {
            boost::lock_guard<boost::mutex> lock(coutMutex);
            std::cout << "Background Task " << id << " is running...\n";
        }
        boost::this_thread::sleep_for(boost::chrono::seconds(1));  // Simulate work
    }

    // Final message when thread exits
    boost::lock_guard<boost::mutex> lock(coutMutex);
    std::cout << "Background Task " << id << " exiting...\n";
}

// Main foreground task
void foregroundTask() {
    std::string input;
    while (running) {
        {

            std::cout << "Foreground: Type 'quit' to exit.\n";

// Entry point
int main() {
    const int numThreads = 3;  // Number of background threads
    std::vector<boost::thread> workers;

    // Start background threads
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        workers.emplace_back(backgroundTask, i + 1);
    }

    // Start foreground task (user interaction)
    foregroundTask();

    // Wait for all background threads to finish
    for (auto& thread : workers) {
        thread.join();
    }

    std::cout << "All threads exited. Program shutting down.\n";
    return 0;
}

== Thread-pool Sample

Starting with the multi-threaded code above. If we engage the thread management features of boost:asio[], and the thread-safe counting of boost:atomic[], we reduce the need to manually handle the management of threads. In particular, the updated sample:

* Uses `boost::asio::thread_pool` instead of manually managing threads.
* Handles atomic operations with `boost::atomic` for thread-safe counters.
* Requires tasks to execute in a pool, instead of fixed background threads.
* Adds a graceful shutdown, allowing running tasks to finish before exiting.

#include <boost/atomic.hpp>
#include <boost/chrono.hpp>

// Atomic flag to signal threads to stop
boost::atomic<bool> running(true);
boost::atomic<int> taskCounter(0);  // Tracks running tasks
boost::mutex coutMutex;  // Synchronizes console output

// Simulated background task
void backgroundTask(int id) {
    taskCounter++;  // Increment task count
    while (running) {
        {
            boost::lock_guard<boost::mutex> lock(coutMutex);
            std::cout << "Task " << id << " is running... (Active tasks: " 
                      << taskCounter.load() << ")\n";
        }

    taskCounter--;  // Decrement task count
    boost::lock_guard<boost::mutex> lock(coutMutex);

    // Wait for all tasks in the pool to complete
    pool.join();

    std::cout << "All tasks completed. Program shutting down.\n";
    return 0;
}

== Message-queue Sample

Now comes the more challenging part, when we want the different threads to _securely_ communicate with each other. To do this we engage the features of boost:lockfree[] and boost:chrono[]:

* A lock-free queue for messages, using `boost::lockfree::queue` for inter-thread communication.
* Background tasks listen for messages, and process incoming messages asynchronously.
* A user can type "msg <text>" to send messages to the background tasks.
* All threads shut down cleanly when "quit" is entered.

            std::string message = input.substr(4);

If you compile and run this sample, the following would be a typical session!

[source,text]
----
Foreground: Type 'quit' to exit, 'add' to add a task, 'msg <text>' to send a message.
add
add
msg Hello, Task!
Task 1 received message: Hello, Task!
Task 2 running... (Active tasks: 2)
quit
Task 1 exiting...
Task 2 exiting...
All tasks completed. Program shutting down.

Parallel computing is an exciting challenge - success should come from focusing on problems that are inherently parallel.
