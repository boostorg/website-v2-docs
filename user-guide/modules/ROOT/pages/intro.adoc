= Introduction

:idseparator: -


Boost is a collection of high-quality and peer-reviewed libraries that aims to make pass:[C++] development highly productive.

Boost is publicly released three times per year (April, August, and December). Each release has updates to existing libraries, and any new libraries that have passed the rigorous acceptance process. Currently, there are over 180 libraries covering a myriad of programming tasks.

== Advantages of using Boost

There are many advantages to using Boost in your pass:[C++] projects, the main one being using Boost avoids reinventing the wheel if there is a library that implements functions that you would otherwise have to write yourself. In addition:

[disc]
* Boost libraries are peer reviewed, well designed, and extensively tested prior to release.
* Boost does not compete with the https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/standard_library[C++ Standard Library]. Rather it complements the Standard with exciting additional functionality. Many components of the Standard started as components of Boost libraries.
* Boost is open-source, and available for you to use in any of your projects. It is free, including for commercial projects. Refer to xref:bsl.adoc[].
* Boost allows for cross-platform development, with single source code. Boost supports Windows, Linux variants, Apple OS X, IOS, Android, and Xbox.
* The Boost Libraries are designed to be as independent as possible so that users can pick and choose the libraries they need without being forced to include unnecessary code. If a library has dependencies these other libraries are loaded automatically if just a subset of the full collection of libraries is being installed.
* Particular strengths of the libraries include extensive documentation, ease of installing and updating, many libraries are header-only, and that less-common use cases are often covered.
* Through _template metaprogramming_ Boost libraries are a good platform for building other libraries.
* Boost can be used in conjunction with graphics and games SDKs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan,  and DirectX, and with game development engines such as the Unreal Engine.
* It is easy to ask questions and share your Boost experiences with other programmers, via the xref:user-community-introduction.adoc[User Community].
* A developer can gain knowledge of what is available. A library may be of no current use, but knowledge of its existence can help in future awareness and planning.
* Bugs, though rare, and other issues can be filed on the library authors, refer to xref:reporting-issues.adoc[].

== Considerations when using Boost

The libraries implement a modern approach to pass:[C++] programming, generally prioritizing performance, correctness, cross-platform portability, efficiency and reusability. Boost offers building blocks, rather than a high-level app framework.

Boost is template-heavy, in order to provide maximum portability and reusability, which can make for dense syntax, which takes some getting used to.

Boost libraries are written by one, or a small team, of independent developers. There will be minor differences in portability, standards, documentation, error reporting, and other aspects, between the libraries. The stringent review process does help minimize these differences.

== Library Categories

The current Boost libraries are categorized as follows - the count shows the number of current libraries in the category.

== Summary

The purpose of the Boost libraries is to evangelize and support pass:[C++] development. You can take advantage of thousands of lines of high performance code.

=== Next Steps

If you are new to Boost, the recommended next step is to download the entire library for your selected OS, and build a few sample programs.
